# The Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise

The goals for this challenge were as followed:
  - Display all the items grouped by "listId"
  - Sort the results first by "listId" then by "name" when displaying.
  - Filter out any items where "name" is blank or null.

I chose to complete this task using React.js for a simple one page display of the information
